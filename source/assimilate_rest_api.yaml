    description: Manage projects of the Assimilate Product Suite instance. In the Projects data model hierarchy a Project contains one or more Groups which in turn contain one of more Constructs. A Construct is, depending on the use case synonym to a Timeline. A Construct contains one or more Slots and each Slot in turn can contain one or more Shots. All first Shots in each Slots make up a Timeline, the other Shots in a Slot can be regarded as Versions or the timeline Shot. A Construct can have sub-Constructs, which together represent a multi-layered timeline. Each Construct can also have multiple Outputs organized in a tree / pipeline of Output nodes that are used to render a timeline. Each Shot in a Project has next to a standard set of properties (like length, in- and out-point, etc.) also contain Framing, Grade and can have other Shots as inputs in case of a composition Shot.
